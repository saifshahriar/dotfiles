Built on Coffee theme by Lex Childs

I don't own the picture. Author cannot be pinpointed due to massive amount of uploads of his work


Installation:

-Drop the theme to "~/.config/leftwm/themes"

-Either rename it as "current" or symlink it to that folder

-Soft reload with Super+Shift+R


You can change date and hour format in polybar.config, line 70-82
